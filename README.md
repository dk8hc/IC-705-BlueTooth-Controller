# IC-705-BlueTooth-Controller
IC-705-BlueTooth-Controller for an Xiegu XPA125B Amplifier.
Fork from: https://github.com/PE1OFO/IC-705-BlueTooth-Controller

Changed for higher Voltages after a Firmwareupdate of the Xiegu XPA125B which doesn't select correct bands in auto mode, check output Voltage for bandswitching before connect it to your Xiegu XPA125B!
